Herman Miller Aeron 
While its iconic form has remained largely unchanged, the Aeron chair has been remastered from the casters up to meet the needs of todays work and workers. With the help of original co-designer, Don Chadwick, we thoughtfully updated the chair based on the latest research around the science of sitting, and advancements in materials, manufacturing, and technology.
